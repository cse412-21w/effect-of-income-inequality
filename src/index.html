      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Income inequality is one of the most prominent examples of inequality in the world and is often described as the wealth gap between the highest incomes and lowest incomes in a society. More formally, income inequality is defined by the uneven distribution of wealth and income in a society. The balance of income inequality is oft debated.</p> 
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">In particular, many studies make the argument that the existence of income inequality is necessary and is simply a part of the nature of a free-market economy that acts as a part of the development of society. For example, by working hard, taking risks, and investing, any individual in a free-market economy may climb to the highest economic income status and achieve wealth.However, critics strongly highlight that such a wealth gap creates severely unfair environments for the lower-income groups of society and can lead to social instability. Effects of economic inequality can lead to effects such as the inhibition of education achievement and even long-term mental health issues for lower-income groups.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Both sides of the argument regarding income inequality make strong points. The existence of income inequality is undeniable and will continue to exist for as long as societies exist as a fuel for social development. However, what is the ultimate balance between income inequality and maintaining a healthy society? This webpage seeks to understand the effects of income inequality on different levels and hopefully lead the readers to their own conclusions.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px">According to a study <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality" target="_blank"><mark>Link</mark></a> performed by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) on the United States of America Internal Revenue Service data, the income gap in the USA experienced little to no change between the late 1940’s and the early 1970’s. All classes of income distribution experienced consistent, strong growth.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">However, as economic growth rapidly slowed in the early 1970’s, the income gap began to widen. Wealth slowly became more concentrated at the upper levels of income distribution and the highest income group in the United States continued its upper trajectory in growth over time. However, the middle and lower class income groups experienced stagnation and eventually steady decline over time. As the economy slowed, smaller businesses and lower income workers lacked the financial powers and savings to withstand the economic impacts.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px">In the above visualization "Percentage of Aggregate USA Incomes by Income Class", the percentage of aggregate USA income is graphed over a period of time by income class. Essentially, the overall population of the United States of America is divided into fifths, with the lowest fifth being a representation of the lowest 20% of income earners in the USA and so on until the highest fifth of income earners in the USA. Each of these divided groups owns a certain percentage of the overall sum total income (aggregate income) of the USA. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">From the visual, every group of income earners excluding the highest fifth earners in the USA experiences a downwards trend of aggregate USA income percentage owned by each class. However, the highest fifth group experiences steady linear growth upwards over this time period from 1967 to 2019. Over time, the income gap has actually gotten worse.</p>

        A closer look at only the bottom fifth and top fifth percent of shares of aggregate USA income shows the lowest fifth of income earners in the USA trends slightly downwards over time, while the highest fifth experiences a significant linear growth over the same time period. The rich continue to grow richer, and the poor continue to grow poorer, creating significant inequality in different aspects of life.

      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Although there is no direct evidence linking income inequality with mental health disorders, namely depression, many studies have found a strong correlation between the two factors. One example of this can be seen in India, where a survey was conducted on Indian citizens in 12 different states. The randomly selected participants were divided into quintiles based on income, from the lowest fifth to the highest fifth earners. On a 95% confidence interval, it was found that the current weighted prevalence of participants in the lowest quintile of income was a mere 2.68%. Current weighted prevalence is described as a subject that has suffered from depression within 2 weeks of the study surveying. Further, a static visual of these statistics indicates a strong correlation between depression disorder rates and income status. As income increases, notable decreases in depression disorder rates are seen, both current and in terms of lifetime.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Another visual can illuminate a reason for this trend. Often, higher GDP or wealthier nations around the globe spend have increased spending on mental health care infrastructure, thus increasing the population’s access to mental health workers. As an individual’s income increases, their ability to spend extra money on mental health care also increases, which could explain lower rates of mental health issues.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">A further explanation for this trend could also be higher income families often experience the effects of increased educational quality. Access to such experiences allow for wealthier children to inherently acquire higher paying jobs. As such, these children will have increased income to spend on mental health care as opposed to children of lower income status. Additionally, in the United States, since public school districts are funded by property tax, economic segregation of school districts will increase as income gaps widen between neighborhoods  Ultimately, many factors play into income inequality, and these effects accumulate into inequalities in other aspects of life.</p>

          A closer look at only the bottom fifth and top fifth percent of shares of aggregate USA income shows the lowest fifth of income earners in the USA trends slightly downwards over time, while the highest fifth experiences a significant linear growth over the same time period. The rich continue to grow richer, and the poor continue to grow poorer, creating significant inequality in different aspects of life.

          Although there is no direct evidence linking income inequality with mental health disorders, namely depression, many studies have found a strong correlation between the two factors. One example of this can be seen in India, where a survey was conducted on Indian citizens in 12 different states. The randomly selected participants were divided into quintiles based on income, from the lowest fifth to the highest fifth earners. On a 95% confidence interval, it was found that the current weighted prevalence of participants in the lowest quintile of income was a mere 2.68%. Current weighted prevalence is described as a subject that has suffered from depression within 2 weeks of the study surveying. Further, a static visual of these statistics indicates a strong correlation between depression disorder rates and income status. As income increases, notable decreases in depression disorder rates are seen, both current and in terms of lifetime.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another visual can illuminate a reason for this trend. Often, higher GDP or wealthier nations around the globe spend have increased spending on mental health care infrastructure, thus increasing the population’s access to mental health workers. As an individual’s income increases, their ability to spend extra money on mental health care also increases, which could explain lower rates of mental health issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          A further explanation for this trend could also be higher income families often experience the effects of increased educational quality. Access to such experiences allow for wealthier children to inherently acquire higher paying jobs. As such, these children will have increased income to spend on mental health care as opposed to children of lower income status. Additionally, in the United States, since public school districts are funded by property tax, economic segregation of school districts will increase as income gaps widen between neighborhoods. Ultimately, many factors play into income inequality, and these effects accumulate into inequalities in other aspects of life.

        Since there is no open data on depression rate and income level for the U.S., India's data is used to show how depression and income are correlated. As we can see, the current depression rate seems to have a strong negative correlation with income level. The higher income level has a much lower current depression rate. On the other hand, depression impacts the most for the low-income class, but not so much for people that make decent money or above.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Conclusion</h1>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Income inequality continues to grow around the world and its effects are widespread in many facets of society. Although some may argue that income inequality is a natural byproduct of developed societies, it is clear that these inequalities result in detrimental effects on various aspects of peoples’ lives. Such effects include, but are not limited to, mental health effects such as depression and educational disparities. Ultimately, these effects result in even more inequality as time progresses, eventually leading to a stagnation of the inequality status quo and a lack of improvement for this social issue.</p>
